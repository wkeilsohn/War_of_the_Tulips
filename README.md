## Media Notes:

For this project, I initially drew all of the images I intended to use. However, after begining to code, it became obvious that I would need additional materials. Therefore, while I still will not be including my own art (at least not initially) I can not take credit for the art I obtained from additional sources such as Upsplash and other royalty free sites. Please see below for a more exhustive list of media contributions.
